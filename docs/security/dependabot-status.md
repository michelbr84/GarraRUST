## Confirmed 2026-05-27 run 44 (~20:45 ET) — all surfaces clean, priority (i)

Health routine ran on 2026-05-27 (~20:45 ET / 00:45 UTC 2026-05-28). Full security scan completed. Priority ladder exhausted at **(i)** — no actionable security work found.

**Open health/ PRs resolved this run:** None open at scan time (PR #550 GAR-725 run 43 already squash-merged as `7143a85`).

**Pending routine/ PRs noted (NOT actioned — routine/ territory):** PR #548 (`routine/202605271220-search-slice11-task-lists`, GAR-721) — open, In Progress, skipped per protocol.

**CI on main (`7143a85`, PR #550 GAR-725 health run 43):** All 20 checks confirmed green via PR #550 check runs.

**Notable change vs run 43:** No change to Dependabot PRs (still 8 open, none security-labeled). No new security advisories.

## Confirmed 2026-05-26 run 34 (~04:45 ET) — all surfaces clean, priority (i)

Health routine ran on 2026-05-26 (~04:45 ET / 08:45 UTC). Full security scan completed. Priority ladder exhausted at **(i)** — no actionable security work found.

**Open health/ PRs resolved this run:** None (none were open).

**Pending routine/ PRs noted (NOT actioned — routine/ territory):** None open.

**CI on main (`f6c3aa5`, PR #533 GAR-710):** All 20 checks passed.

**Notable change vs run 33:** Dependabot PR count reduced from 11 to 9 (wasmtime-wasi auto-closed after GAR-708 merge; dtolnay/rust-toolchain also closed).

**argon2 upstream:** Still `0.6.0-rc.8` (RC, not stable); GAR-669 Slices 3–4 remain blocked until stable release.

**Security review — routine/ PR #490 (GAR-499 agent team MVP):** New `team.rs` module (486 LOC) in `garraia-cli`. Pure Rust, no network, no file I/O in production code.

Health routine ran on 2026-05-23 (~08:45 ET / 12:45 UTC). Full security scan completed.

**Open PRs resolved this run:** PR #482 (GAR-690 run 18 status note, branch `health/202605230445-run18-status-note`) was open with all 20 CI checks green — **merged as first action** (squash at `850d44c`). GAR-690 already marked Done.

**Finding (priority h):** Branch `claude/focused-cray-BM98J` contained prepared but un-PR'd commits from health run 18 fixing `cargo deny` `advisory-not-detected` noise for two IDs:
- `RUSTSEC-2024-0429` (glib 0.18.5 VariantStrIter unsound) → cargo deny advisory DB no longer matches this version
- `RUSTSEC-2026-0097` (rand 0.7.3 thread_rng unsound) → cargo deny advisory DB no longer matches this version

Both IDs are retained in `audit.toml` (cargo audit still matches them; `--deny unsound` gate still enforced). Removed from `deny.toml` only. Plan 0169 / GAR-513.

**Security review — bootstrap/channels.rs + bootstrap/discord.rs:** Pure extractions from `bootstrap/mod.rs`. No behavior change, no new external dependencies, no new attack surface. No command injection, no PII exposure, no unsafe blocks introduced.

**RUSTSEC-2026-0149 (wasmtime-wasi 44.0.1) — FIXED:**
- Advisory: WASI path_open(TRUNCATE) bypasses `FilePerms::WRITE` host restriction (GHSA-2r75-cxrj-cmph)
- Vector: WASI guest could open files with O_TRUNC even with host `FilePerms::WRITE` restriction set
- Impact: `garraia-plugins` (WASM sandbox) via `wasmtime-wasi 44.0.1`
- Fix: `cargo update -p wasmtime-wasi --precise 44.0.2` — bumps wasmtime-wasi + wasmtime + cranelift-* ecosystem 44.0.1 → 44.0.2
- GAR-685 → Done, included in PR #472

**Upstream-blocked unchanged:** Both remaining Dependabot alerts continue to require argon2 ≥ 0.6 stable from upstream. Latest on crates.io: `argon2 = "0.6.0-rc.8"` (RC, not stable). No unblock path until stable release.

## Confirmed 2026-05-21 run 11 (health routine — upstream-blocked state unchanged; SSE stream + audit-log reviewed clean)

Health routine ran on 2026-05-21 (~16:45 ET). Full security scan completed. Priority ladder exhausted at (i) — no actionable security work found.

**New merges since run 10:** PR #459 (`d25b64c`, GAR-678 — `GET /v1/chats/{id}/stream` SSE endpoint + DashMap GC fix + cross-tenant RLS test), PR #462 (`3ddaf3e`, post-merge bookkeeping), PR #463 (`a972947`, GAR-680 — audit-log of SSE chat subscriptions via `chat.subscribed`/`chat.unsubscribed` event pairs).

**Security review — SSE stream handler + ChatStreamGuard:**
- `stream_chat` handler performs RLS context (`SET LOCAL app.current_user_id / app.current_group_id`) inside a proper `pool.begin()` transaction — no implicit auto-commit race (F-2 fix in PR #459).
- `ChatStreamGuard` RAII drop emits `chat.unsubscribed` via a fire-and-forget `tokio::spawn` using `Handle::try_current` — safe no-op when no runtime (test teardown). No PII in metadata (`subscriber_count` integer only).
- `DashMap::remove_if` GC on last receiver drop prevents unbounded memory growth (F-1 fix in PR #459). Race-safe under concurrent subscribe via entry lock.
- All `unwrap()` calls in `rest_v1_chats_sse.rs` are inside `#[cfg(test)]` / integration test blocks per CLAUDE.md rules.
- No new external dependencies introduced. No Cargo.lock security impact.

**Open PRs (not health/):** PR #464 (`michelduek/gar-680-post-merge-bookkeeping`, docs-only ROADMAP update) — CI in progress at time of health run (17/20 checks green, ubuntu/windows/coverage still running).

**Upstream-blocked unchanged:** Both remaining Dependabot alerts continue to require argon2 ≥ 0.6 from upstream before they can be resolved. No argon2 release supporting `password-hash ^0.6` on crates.io as of 2026-05-21 16:45 ET.

## Confirmed 2026-05-21 run 10 (health routine — upstream-blocked state unchanged; repo_workflow.rs reviewed clean)

Health routine ran on 2026-05-21 (~12:45 ET). Full security scan completed. Priority ladder exhausted at (i) — no actionable security work found.

**New merge since run 9:** PR #455 (`1b7f04c`, GAR-496 — repo workflow seguro para garra max-power) squash-merged to main as `671f760` at 12:11 ET — pure CLI feature addition, no new crate dependencies, no Cargo.lock security impact.

**Security review — repo_workflow.rs:** New module reviewed for command injection. `ProcessRunner` uses `std::process::Command::new(program).args(rest)` with separate `&[&str]` arguments — no shell involved, no string concatenation into a shell command. Protected-branch guard (`is_protected_branch`) correctly refuses direct pushes to `main`, `master`, `release/*`. All `unwrap()` calls confined to `#[cfg(test)]` blocks per CLAUDE.md rules. No security issues found.

**Open PRs (not health/):** PR #458 (`chore/ignore-claude-skills-local`) — 19/20 CI checks green (Windows test still in progress); PR #459 (`routine/202605211215-chats-sse-stream`) — skipped per rules (routine/ prefix).

**Upstream-blocked unchanged:** Both remaining Dependabot alerts continue to require argon2 ≥ 0.6 from upstream before they can be resolved (same finding as run 8). No argon2 release supporting `password-hash ^0.6` on crates.io as of 2026-05-21 09:00 ET.

## Confirmed 2026-05-21 run 8 (health routine — password-hash + rand build-dep upstream-blocked, no actionable fix)

Health routine ran on 2026-05-21 (~04:45 ET). Full security scan completed. Priority ladder exhausted at (i) — no actionable security work found.

**Key finding:** `password-hash 0.5→0.6` (Dependabot alert #430, GAR-669 Slice 3) is **upstream-blocked**. Registry scan confirmed that `argon2 0.5.3` is the latest argon2 release and only supports `password-hash ^0.5`. No argon2 version compatible with password-hash 0.6 has been published on crates.io as of 2026-05-21. The `rand = "0.8"` pin in `crates/garraia-auth` `[build-dependencies]` is a direct consequence of the same constraint (`build.rs` uses `password_hash::rand_core::OsRng` from rand_core 0.6; upgrading rand in build-deps requires upgrading password-hash first). Both GAR-669 Slice 3 and Slice 4 remain deferred until argon2 publishes a release supporting `password-hash ^0.6`.

## Confirmed 2026-05-20 run 7 (health routine — GAR-669 Slice 1: rand_chacha 0.9 + rand 0.9 co-bump)

Health routine ran on 2026-05-20 (run 7, ~08:45 ET / 12:45 UTC). Full security scan completed. Fix applied: co-bumped `rand_chacha` 0.3→0.9 and `rand` 0.8→0.9 in `garraia-workspace` dev-deps, renamed `gen_range` → `random_range` in `migration_smoke.rs`. Root cause: rand_chacha 0.9 requires rand_core 0.9 while rand 0.8 uses rand_core 0.6 — type mismatch on `SeedableRng`. Supersedes Dependabot PR #423.

## Confirmed 2026-05-17 run 2 (health routine — RUSTSEC-2025-0134 closed, axum-server 0.7→0.8)

Health routine ran on 2026-05-17 (run 2, ~05:00 ET). Full security scan completed. Highest actionable issue found: RUSTSEC-2025-0134 (`rustls-pemfile` unmaintained), fixed by bumping `axum-server` 0.7→0.8 (which no longer depends on `rustls-pemfile`). Priority ladder exhausted at (i) after merging.

Health routine ran on 2026-05-14. Full `cargo audit` + `cargo deny check` scan completed.

**Fix applied this run:**

| Package | Before | After | Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| `metrics` | 0.24.5 (**yanked**) | **0.24.6** | Lockfile-only patch (`cargo update -p "metrics@0.24.5"`) |

`metrics 0.24.5` was yanked from crates.io (Dependabot PR #287 introduced it). Updated to `0.24.6` (latest non-yanked patch). The API surface is unchanged — `counter`, `gauge`, `histogram` macros remain stable. `cargo audit --deny unsound` warning count: **22 → 21** (yanked warning resolved).

**Dependency hygiene observation:** `tracing-opentelemetry` bumped from 0.27.0 → 0.32.1 (PR #285, Dependabot) introduced a second copy of `opentelemetry 0.31.0` alongside the existing `0.26.0`. Both are transitive via `garraia-telemetry`; no security advisory affects either version. This is a quality concern (duplicate major version), not a security risk. Tracked under normal dependency hygiene.

Alert count: **3 open** (unchanged). All 3 are upstream-blocked with 2026-07-31 expiry.

## Confirmed 2026-05-12 (health routine — GAR-591 merged, rustls-webpki 0.102.8 chain removed)

Health routine ran on 2026-05-14 (run 2, ~8:50 AM ET). Full security scan completed. Highest actionable issue: `metrics 0.24.5` (yanked from crates.io). PR #336 (`claude/focused-cray-9fubA`) implements the lockfile-only patch.

| Change | Result |

| Dependabot alerts closed | ⚠️ 0 — serenity chain (`rustls-webpki 0.102.8`) still carries all 4 RUSTSEC IDs |
| `cargo clippy --workspace --tests --exclude garraia-desktop --features garraia-gateway/test-helpers --no-deps -- -D warnings` | ✅ clean |
| Secret scanning | ✅ pass |
| CodeQL | ✅ 22 alerts all dismissed (unchanged) |

Alert count unchanged (8 open). The `rustls-webpki 0.101.7` sub-chain that contributed to
RUSTSEC-2026-0098/0099/0104 has been removed from the dependency graph. Dependabot alerts remain
open because `rustls-webpki 0.102.8` (serenity 0.12.5 chain) still independently carries all 4 IDs.
The `audit.toml`/`deny.toml` allowlists are UNCHANGED — still required for the serenity chain.

## Confirmed 2026-05-08 (health routine — all surfaces green)

Health routine ran on 2026-05-08. All 4 security surfaces scanned:

| Surface | Result |
|---|---|
| Secret scanning (gitleaks) | ✅ pass |
| cargo-deny (advisories) | ✅ pass — all allowlisted |
| Security Audit (cargo-audit) | ✅ pass — all allowlisted |
| Dependabot alerts | ✅ 8 open, all pre-existing, all allowlisted (GAR-455 / GAR-513 / GAR-456) |
| CodeQL (code scanning) | ✅ 22 alerts all dismissed in ledger (alerts #40–#45 hard-coded-crypto-value + #67–#82 path-injection false positives). No new open alerts. Re-audit deadline: 2026-08-01. |

No new untracked alerts. Count reconciled: 8 Dependabot open (2 HIGH, 2 MEDIUM, 4 LOW) — all pre-existing, all upstream-blocked, all allowlisted. Main branch CI green. Open routine/ PR: #217 (task subtasks slice 9 — roadmap routine, unrelated to health). Linear status note filed under GAR team (label: automation,health-routine).

A targeted deep-dive on GAR-455 / Dependabot alert #37
(RUSTSEC-2026-0104, `rustls-webpki` panic in CRL parsing) ran the same
day. Verdict: still upstream-blocked. Details and a new finding about
the AWS sub-chain are recorded in the next sub-section.

## GAR-455 deep-dive 2026-05-08 — alert #37 closure investigation

Triggered by a question of whether GAR-455 could close today without
breaking the project. Read-only investigation; no `Cargo.toml` /
`Cargo.lock` / `deny.toml` / `.cargo/audit.toml` changes were made.

### Verdict

Alert #37 (RUSTSEC-2026-0104) **stays open and remains
upstream-blocked**. The allowlist entry in `.cargo/audit.toml` and the
mirror in `deny.toml` continue to be the correct mitigation.

### Empirical chain map (verified 2026-05-08 via `cargo tree`)

```
rustls-webpki 0.102.8  ← serenity 0.12.5
                         → tokio-tungstenite 0.21.0
                         → rustls 0.22.4
                         (always-on; reachable from garraia-channels +
                          garraia-cli + garraia-gateway)
                         carries ALL 4 RUSTSEC IDs of GAR-455
                         (RUSTSEC-2026-0049 / -0098 / -0099 / -0104)

rustls-webpki 0.101.7  ← aws-sdk-s3 1.119.0 (feature `rustls`)
                         → aws-smithy-runtime 1.11.1 (feature `tls-rustls`)
                         → aws-smithy-http-client 1.1.12
                           (feature `legacy-rustls-ring`)
                         → `legacy-rustls` (renamed dep, points at
                           rustls 0.21.12)
                         (only when `garraia-storage/storage-s3`
                          feature is enabled)
                         carries 3 of 4 RUSTSEC IDs (-0098, -0099, -0104)
```

### Upstream version snapshot (crates.io, 2026-05-08)

| Crate | Lockfile | crates.io latest | Last published | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `serenity` | 0.12.5 | **0.12.5** | 2025-12-20 | No 0.13.x or 0.14+ stable release. The `tokio-tungstenite 0.21` pin is internal to serenity 0.12.5; only serenity itself can lift it. |
| `tokio-tungstenite` | 0.21.0 (via serenity) | 0.29.0 | 2026-03-17 | Workspace already declares 0.26 elsewhere; the 0.21 copy is exclusively dragged in by serenity. |
| `aws-sdk-s3` | 1.119.0 | 1.132.0 | 2026-05-06 | A version bump alone does NOT remove rustls 0.21 — `aws-smithy-http-client` is still 1.1.12 underneath. |
| `aws-smithy-http-client` | 1.1.12 | **1.1.12** | 2026-03-02 | Already supports modern rustls 0.23.31 via the `rustls-ring` / `rustls-aws-lc` features. The legacy chain is opt-in through `legacy-rustls-ring`. |

Conclusion on the serenity side: **no upstream path exists today**.
The 0.102.8 chain is purely waiting on a serenity 0.13 (or a 0.12
maintenance release that bumps `tokio-tungstenite`). Re-check on the
next monthly health routine.

### New finding — the AWS sub-chain is feature-flag-fixable, not version-blocked

The earlier mitigation column described the `0.101.7` chain as
upstream-blocked on an `aws-smithy-http-client` upgrade. That framing
is no longer accurate. Empirical reading of the upstream `Cargo.toml`s
on 2026-05-08:

- `aws-sdk-s3 1.119.0`: `rustls = ["aws-smithy-runtime/tls-rustls"]`
- `aws-smithy-runtime 1.11.1`: `tls-rustls = ["aws-smithy-http-client?/legacy-rustls-ring", "connector-hyper-0-14-x"]`
- `aws-smithy-http-client 1.1.12`:
  - `legacy-rustls-ring = ["dep:legacy-hyper-rustls", "dep:legacy-rustls", ...]` (legacy `rustls 0.21.x` renamed)
  - `rustls-ring` / `rustls-aws-lc` → `dep:rustls` at version `0.23.31`

In other words, `aws-sdk-s3 1.119`'s `rustls` feature aliases to the
**legacy** chain, while the same crate ships a separate
`default-https-client` feature that maps to the **modern** rustls 0.23
chain (via `aws-smithy-http-client/rustls-aws-lc`).

`crates/garraia-storage/Cargo.toml` currently passes `features =
["behavior-version-latest", "rustls", "rt-tokio"]` to both
`aws-config` and `aws-sdk-s3`. Note that on `aws-config 1.8.16` the
`rustls` alias already maps to modern rustls 0.23 (via `client-hyper`
→ `aws-smithy-runtime/default-https-client` →
`aws-smithy-http-client/rustls-aws-lc`); only the `aws-sdk-s3` side
flips to the legacy chain.

### What this finding does and does not change

- It DOES open a defense-in-depth path on the AWS sub-chain: swapping
  the `aws-sdk-s3` feature `"rustls"` for `"default-https-client"`
  would remove `rustls 0.21.12` and `rustls-webpki 0.101.7` from
  `Cargo.lock`, eliminating one of the two chains carrying
  RUSTSEC-2026-0098 / -0099 / -0104.
- It DOES NOT close Dependabot alert #37 (or any of the other 3
  GAR-455 alerts). The serenity-driven `rustls-webpki 0.102.8` chain
  carries all 4 RUSTSEC IDs independently. As long as serenity 0.12.5
  is on the lockfile, the allowlist entries for the 4 IDs in
  `.cargo/audit.toml` and `deny.toml` are required.
- The `audit.toml` SYNC NOTE invariant is therefore unaffected: the 4
  rustls-webpki IDs continue to mirror across both files, atomic drop
  still gated on the serenity bump.

### Follow-up (COMPLETED 2026-05-09 — plan 0087, GAR-553, PR health/202605090047)

The AWS-side feature-flag swap has been **landed** in plan 0087 (health
routine 2026-05-09). `crates/garraia-storage/Cargo.toml` now uses
`"default-https-client"` instead of `"rustls"` for `aws-sdk-s3`:

- `rustls 0.21.12`, `rustls-webpki 0.101.7`, `hyper-rustls 0.24.2`
  removed from `Cargo.lock`.
- S3 connectivity preserved via modern rustls 0.23 + aws-lc chain.
- `cargo clippy --workspace --tests --exclude garraia-desktop --features garraia-gateway/test-helpers --no-deps -- -D warnings` clean.

The originally-recommended validation from this section remains accurate:

- `cargo audit` and `cargo deny check` should still pass; the 4
  rustls-webpki residual IDs continue to be triggered by the serenity
  chain, so neither file changes.

The Linear placement for that follow-up is GAR-455 itself (or a
sub-issue under it) — not a new epic — because the residual surface
remains the same RUSTSEC IDs.

## Confirmed 2026-05-07 (health routine — no new alerts)

Health routine ran on 2026-05-07. All 4 security surfaces scanned:

| Surface | Result |
|---|---|
| Secret scanning (gitleaks) | ✅ pass |
| cargo-deny (advisories) | ✅ pass — all allowlisted |
| Security Audit (cargo-audit) | ✅ pass — all allowlisted |
| Dependabot alerts | ✅ 8 open, all pre-existing, all allowlisted (GAR-455 / GAR-513 / GAR-456) |

No new untracked alerts. Count reconciled: 8 open (2 HIGH, 2 MEDIUM, 4 LOW) matching the 8 active RUSTSEC IDs in `.cargo/audit.toml`. The "6 estimated" in the 2026-05-06 snapshot was incorrect — the `rsa` RUSTSEC-2023-0071 entry was added to `audit.toml` on 2026-04-30 when `jsonwebtoken 10 rust_crypto` backend brought `rsa 0.9.10` into the production tree (GAR-456). The `openssl` fix on 2026-05-06 closed a separate advisory not in this table. PR #188 (`health/ratchet-20260507-gitignore-local-reports`) merged — added `.github-health-reports/` and `audit/` to `.gitignore` to unblock future health routine iterations.

Dependabot rescan expected within 24-48h. Until rescan completes, GH UI still shows 8 open.

## Residuals (3 open post-rescan, updated 2026-05-12 run 2)

All 3 remaining alerts have:
- A specific RUSTSEC ID matching `Cargo.lock`.
- A documented rationale block in `.cargo/audit.toml` and/or `deny.toml`.
- A concrete Linear owner.
- An expiration date (**2026-07-31**) that forces re-triage.

The `cargo audit` and `cargo deny` CI gates pass green because each entry
is intentionally allowlisted, not silenced.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| — | — | HIGH | `rsa` | RUSTSEC-2023-0071 (Marvin Attack timing sidechannel) | GAR-456 | `rsa 0.9.10` enters tree via two paths: (1) `sqlx-mysql` lockfile residual even with `default-features = false` on all sqlx deps; (2) `jsonwebtoken 10 rust_crypto` backend (added 2026-04-30). GarraRUST emits/verifies HS256 only (`Algorithm::HS256` in `garraia-auth/src/jwt.rs`) — no RSA code path is reachable. Fix paths: (a) `jsonwebtoken` upstream isolates `rsa` behind `asymmetric` feature; (b) migrate to `sqlx-postgres` direct or sqlx 0.9. |

## Linear ownership map

- **GAR-455** — ✅ CLOSED 2026-05-12. `rustls-webpki` legacy chains fully removed. Both chains eliminated: aws-smithy (plan 0087, 2026-05-09) + serenity (PR #293, 2026-05-12). 4 of 8 former alerts (#37, #11, #23, #22) closing pending Dependabot rescan.
- **GAR-513** — Unsound triage carve-out (created 2026-05-05; GAR-437 closed 2026-04-27). 2 of 3 remaining alerts (#2 glib, #25 rand). lru (#5 / RUSTSEC-2026-0002) closed 2026-05-12 by GAR-593 / PR #299. Each remaining entry tracked individually as upstream fixes ship.
- **GAR-456** — Marvin Attack timing sidechannel (`rsa 0.9.10`). 1 of 4 remaining alerts (RUSTSEC-2023-0071; GH alert number unknown — cargo audit detects it as workspace advisory). GarraRUST emits and verifies HS256 only; no RSA call site is reachable. Same `2026-07-31` expiration.

## Re-triage cadence

- **Weekly** (Monday): cargo-audit.yml runs `cargo audit --no-fetch
  --deny unsound`. Output reviewed alongside CodeQL Monday-morning batch.
- **Quarterly** (every 3 months): every `audit.toml` ignore is checked
  against its declared expiration. Any past-expiration entry without
  a closing PR triggers immediate Linear sub-issue creation.
- **Ad-hoc**: a Dependabot alert that does NOT match an existing
  allowlist entry is treated as a real new vulnerability and follows
  the standard mitigation procedure (`docs/security/secret-scanning-runbook.md`
  — same 5-step playbook applies analogously).

## Operational checks

```bash
# Snapshot of open Dependabot alerts (mirrors this table when in sync)
gh api repos/michelbr84/GarraRUST/dependabot/alerts --paginate \
  --jq '.[] | select(.state=="open") | {n: .number, severity: .security_advisory.severity, package: .dependency.package.name, ghsa: .security_advisory.ghsa_id}'

# Audit allowlist consistency check
grep -E "^\s*\"RUSTSEC-" .cargo/audit.toml | sort
grep -E "^\s*\"RUSTSEC-" deny.toml | sort
# (the two MUST share the mandatory-sync IDs: rsa, glib, rand
#  per .cargo/audit.toml SYNC NOTE — refreshed 2026-05-12 by GAR-593)

# Verify cargo audit / cargo deny stay green with the allowlist active
cargo audit
cargo deny check
```

## Out of scope (tracked separately)

- Closing the 90 CodeQL alerts — see Linear `GAR-XXX.4` (production
  paths) and `GAR-XXX.5` (test fixtures + suppression convention).
  CodeQL alerts are NOT Dependabot alerts and use a different triage
  pipeline (`docs/security/codeql-setup.md`).
- Moving from `cargo audit` 0.22.x to a version that supports
  per-(advisory, version) ignores — would let us tighten the
  rustls-webpki block without weakening the production hot path.
  Tracked under GAR-455 closure plan.
